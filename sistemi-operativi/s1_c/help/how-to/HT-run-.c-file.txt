How to run a .c file:
    0. Simple
        gcc fileName.c              # Generate the executable file
        ./a.out
    1. Invocation of the entire toolchain
        gcc -o fileName fileName.c  # Generate the executable file
        ./fileName
    2. Creation of the executable file by generating assembly code
        gcc -S fileName.c           # Generate the assembly code
            cut fileName.S              # To see the assembly code
        gcc fileName.s              # Generate the executable file from the assembly code
        ./a.out
    3. Creation of the executable file by object file
        gcc -c filename.c           # Generate the object file fileName.o
        gcc fileName.o              # Calls the linker ang gaenerate the executable file from the object file
        ./a.out
